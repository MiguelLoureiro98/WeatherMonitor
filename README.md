# WeatherMonitor

A simple, Arduino-based Weather Station with an associated Python app.

The station is equipped with temperature, humidity, and light sensors, and the user will be able to monitor their values using the Python web app. Additional functionality, such as sampling time selection, signal filtering, and saving to a file and/or database will also be provided.

This project is currently under development.
